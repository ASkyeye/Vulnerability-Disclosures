# CVE-2021-45338.3

## Description

AvastSvc exposes RPC-interface, named *"Aavm"* with uuid *eb915940-6276-11d2-b8e7-006097c59f07*, which
contains method *Proc64* that allows trusted (in terms of self-defense) restricted user to reset arbitrary 
file DACL without impersonation. Vulnerable pseudocode is shown below:

```
__int64 Proc64_AavmSetFileSecurity(void *contextHandle, const WCHAR *filePath, unsigned int unk_0, unsigned int unk_1)
{
  if ( !dword_1805C7AC4 )
    return 2147771136i64;
  if ( secIsPathProtectedBySelfProtection(filePath, 0i64) )
    return 5i64;
  result = basImexExportSettings(filePath, unk_0, unk_1);
  if ( !result )
  {
    publicSecurity = dep_secGetPublicSecurity();
    SetFileSecurityW(filePath, DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION, (PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR)(publicSecurity + 2072));
    result = v6;
  }
  return result;
}
```

## Impact

Local privilege escalation vulnerability in Avast Free Antivirus prior to 20.4 allows a restricted user 
to reset arbitrary file/directory DACL and as result execute arbitrary code as "NT Authority\System".

## Steps to reproduce

1. Run *rundll32.exe AavmArbitraryFileSetSecurityExploit.dll,Exploit*;
2. Connect with telnet client (via puttytel.exe) to *localhost:4444*;
3. Enjoy SYSTEM privileges!

## Resolution

This issue fixed since Avast 20.4.
