# CVE-2021-45338.2

## Description

AvastSvc exposes RPC-interface, named *"Aavm"* with uuid *eb915940-6276-11d2-b8e7-006097c59f07*, which
contains method *Proc81* that allows trusted (in terms of self-defense) restricted user to move arbitrary 
file without impersonation. Vulnerable pseudocode is shown below:

```
DWORD Proc81_AavmMoveFile(void *contextHandle, const WCHAR *srcPath, const WCHAR *dstPath, DWORD flags)
{
  if ( !dword_1806E3F7C )
    return -2147196160;
  if ( MoveFileExW(srcPath, dstPath, flags) )
    return 0;
  return GetLastError();
}
```

## Impact

Local privilege escalation vulnerability in Avast Free Antivirus prior to 20.4 allows a restricted user 
to move arbitrary file/directory and as result execute arbitrary code as "NT Authority\System".

## Steps to reproduce

1. Run *rundll32.exe AavmArbitraryFileMoveExploit.dll,Exploit*;
2. Connect with telnet client (via puttytel.exe) to *localhost:4444*;
3. Enjoy SYSTEM privileges!
